# Udemy_course_rating_prediction
This project focuses on the development of a predictive Machine Learning model 
designed to estimate the ratings of Udemy courses. Leveraging a substantial dataset 
comprising over 83,000 course records and 32,000 instructor profiles, our objective is to 
explore the potential of regression algorithms like XGBoost, Decision Trees, and Random 
Forest Regressor in uncovering underlying patterns related to course popularity and the 
influence of instructors. Through careful feature engineering, we aim to construct an effective 
predictive framework. The performance evaluation of the model will involve key metrics such 
as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), providing essential 
insights into its predictive accuracy. 
Our approach facilitates prospective learners in making informed decisions by offering 
a glimpse into the expected ratings of Udemy courses. This project not only sheds light on the 
factors influencing course ratings but also underscores the potential of machine learning in 
drawing meaningful insights from extensive educational data.
